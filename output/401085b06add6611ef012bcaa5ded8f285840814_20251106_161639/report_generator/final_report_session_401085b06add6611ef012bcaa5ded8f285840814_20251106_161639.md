# Forensic Case Report

## 1. Final Verdict and Executive Summary

- **Verdict:** **Malicious**
- **Confidence Level:** 1.0 (Authoritative, maximum confidence)
- **Reasoning Summary:**  
  A holistic review of all evidence reveals overwhelming indicators of a malicious phishing attempt, despite the absence of active exploit code or a currently live payload. The visual analysis exposes classic phishing tactics: brand impersonation (Bank of America), urgent psychological manipulation, and—most critically—interactive deception, where a link visually mimics the legitimate bank URL but actually points to a typosquatted domain. This is a textbook phishing lure designed to trick users into divulging sensitive information. The presence of a hidden tracking/redirect link, routed through a newly registered shortener and ultimately to a suspicious, unrelated domain, further corroborates the intent to obfuscate and facilitate malicious activity (credential harvesting or similar). While static and structural analysis found no active code or embedded malware, this is not a contradiction but a limitation of static methods: the threat here is social engineering and user compromise, not technical exploitation. The 'weakest link' principle applies: the deceptive interactive elements and the infrastructure behind the links are sufficient to classify this file as malicious, regardless of the current inactivity of the phishing infrastructure. The file's sole purpose is to compromise the reader through deception. All evidence is consistent and mutually reinforcing; there are no credible benign explanations.

- **Investigation Overview:**  
  This investigation encompassed static, structural, visual, and dynamic link analysis of a single-page PDF purporting to be a Bank of America notification. The file was found to employ advanced phishing tactics, including brand impersonation, psychological manipulation, and deceptive hyperlinks. Dynamic analysis of embedded URLs confirmed the use of typosquatted domains and a suspicious redirect chain, both hallmarks of credential harvesting campaigns. While no active payload was present at the time of analysis, the document's design and infrastructure leave no doubt as to its malicious intent.

## 3. Executive Summary

The investigation targeted a single-page PDF masquerading as a Bank of America alert. The document was visually convincing, employing official branding and urgent language to induce fear and prompt user action. Forensic analysis revealed the following:

- **Visual Analysis:**  
  The document is highly deceptive, using brand impersonation, psychological manipulation, and interactive deception. The most prominent link appears to be the official bank URL but actually points to a typosquatted, malicious domain. A hidden tracking/redirect link is also embedded.

- **Static and Structural Analysis:**  
  No active exploit code, scripts, or embedded malware were found. The PDF's structure is consistent with a passive document, but this does not mitigate the risk posed by its social engineering content.

- **Dynamic Link Analysis:**  
  The primary phishing URL is currently unregistered and unreachable, but its construction and context are classic indicators of phishing. The hidden tracking link leads through a suspicious redirect chain involving a newly registered shortener and an unrelated domain, ultimately ending at a dead page. The infrastructure and tactics are consistent with credential harvesting campaigns.

- **Correlated Threat Intelligence:**  
  All findings are mutually reinforcing: the visual deception aligns with the technical evidence of malicious infrastructure, confirming the document's sole purpose is to compromise the user.

## 4. Detailed Investigative Narrative

### Phase 1: Preprocessing and Static Triage

- **Initial Impression:**  
  The file was subjected to static triage, which found no evidence of embedded scripts, JavaScript, automatic actions, or active exploit code. The anatomical report classified the document as "innocent" from a technical exploitation perspective, citing the absence of high-risk PDF features.

- **Reasoning:**  
  The triage agent noted that while the document's anatomy was benign, this did not account for user-targeted social engineering threats.

### Phase 2: In-Depth Static Analysis

- **Structural Investigation:**  
  - PDF version 1.7, 44 objects, 10 streams.
  - No encryption, no embedded files, no JavaScript, no `/OpenAction`, `/Launch`, or `/EmbeddedFile`.
  - Standard XMP metadata; no evidence of toolchain obfuscation.
  - One `/Names` entry flagged as "suspicious" by peepdf, but not actionable in isolation.
  - No attack chain or indicators of compromise were found in the static evidence graph.

### Phase 3: Visual Analysis

- **Overall Assessment:**  
  The visual analysis agent delivered a verdict of **"Highly Deceptive"** with maximum confidence.

- **Document Layout and Purpose:**  
  - Professional Bank of America branding and logo at the top.
  - Formal, urgent language warning of a "temporary hold" due to "suspicious activity."
  - A prominent blue hyperlink styled as the official bank URL, but actually pointing to a typosquatted domain.
  - Hidden annotation link (not visually indicated) embedded near the main message.

- **Deception Tactics Identified:**
  1. **Brand Impersonation:** Use of official branding and language to gain trust.
  2. **Interactive Element Deception:** Visible link text claims to be the official site, but the actual URL is a malicious typosquat.
  3. **Psychological Manipulation:** Urgent, fear-inducing language to prompt immediate action.
  4. **Hidden Tracking Link:** Non-disclosed annotation link for tracking or redirection.

- **Signals of Legitimacy:**  
  Only standard PDF metadata; no technical anomalies.

### Phase 4: Dynamic Link Analysis

#### 1. **Phishing Link (`https://bankofamerica.comjmhbh.com`):**

- **Investigation Steps:**
  - Two navigation attempts failed with DNS resolution errors.
  - WHOIS lookup confirmed the domain is unregistered and inactive.
- **Analyst Conclusion:**  
  The domain is a clear typosquat, intended for phishing, but is currently inactive. The context and construction are sufficient to classify it as suspicious and malicious in intent.

#### 2. **Hidden Tracking/Redirect Link (`https://insight.adsrvr.org/track/clk?...`):**

- **Investigation Steps:**
  - Initial tracking URL issued a 302 redirect to a newly registered shortener (`theshorturl.com`).
  - The shortener issued a 301 redirect to an unrelated domain (`mittalslabglassware.com`) with a path referencing "bankofamerica."
  - The final page returned a 404 Not Found error.
  - WHOIS checks:
    - `theshorturl.com`: Registered October 2025 (very recent, suspicious).
    - `mittalslabglassware.com`: Registered 2018 (older, but likely compromised or abused).
- **Analyst Conclusion:**  
  The redirect chain is highly suspicious, involving a fresh shortener and an unrelated final domain. The infrastructure and tactics are consistent with credential harvesting or phishing campaigns, though the campaign is currently offline.

## 5. Correlated Threat Intelligence

- **Cross-Domain Confirmation:**  
  - The **visual analysis** flagged the main hyperlink as deceptive, and **dynamic link analysis** confirmed the destination is a typosquatted, malicious domain.
  - The **hidden annotation link** identified visually was confirmed by dynamic analysis to be a tracking/redirector leading through a suspicious, multi-step chain involving a newly registered shortener and a final domain with a banking reference in the path.
  - The **absence of active exploit code** in static analysis is not contradictory; the threat is social engineering, not technical exploitation.
  - The **combination of urgent language, brand impersonation, and deceptive links** is a classic phishing pattern, confirmed by both visual and technical analysis.
  - The **infrastructure** (newly registered shortener, unrelated final domain) is consistent with known attack chains for credential harvesting, even though the payload is currently offline.

- **Synthesis:**  
  The document's visual deception is directly supported by the technical evidence of malicious infrastructure. The attack chain, while currently inactive, is architected for phishing and credential theft. All findings are mutually reinforcing, with no credible benign explanation.
